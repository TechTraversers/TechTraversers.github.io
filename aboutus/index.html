        <h4>Levi Bryan</h4>
        <p>Hello! I'm Levi Bryan. I currently provide many of the more advanced programming techniques for the business. I like People, Programming, Pickleball, and Pets! I also work part-time in a few different businesses, but my goal is to go full-time at Tech Traversers! CodeSmith95 and I have been friends for a long time and both enjoy computers, programming, and technology. We decided to help people and make a little money while doing it! Hence, Tech Traversers! My hope is to keep learning, keep growing, and to use my skills to make technology more accessible and friendly for everyone we work with.</p>

        <h4>Codesmith95</h4>
        <p>Hi! As you might have already guessed, this isn't my real name. However, my internet anonymity won't stop me from providing quality help and programming. A little about me: I like cats. I also like easter eggs in apps and games, so if you're the kind of person who digs into source code, I expect you to find some of that. ;)</p>

        <h4 style="margin-bottom:0px;">The Company</h4>

        <p>The business is dedicated to providing affordable solutions to software issues you may have. We also program custom applications. Our main goal is to provide professional care, not to make money. We provide friends and relatives with free assistance with their tech needs; we wish we could do the same for you. Unfortunately, we can't always do that due to time constraints and the need to prioritize paid work. We decided to offer cheap rates to make our services accessible to more people.</p>
