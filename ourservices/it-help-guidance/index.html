        <h2>IT Help — For Anyone!</h2>
        <p>This is our main capacity as of this point. Therefore, we will be the most skilled in it. We provide helpful guides and troubleshooting to get your systems running. Currently, we charge $10 an hour, this includes but is not limited to phone calls, texting, active troubleshooting, and emails. Contact us if you feel like this rate is unreasonable. We accept payment via PayPal, Cash (if you live near Buffalo, WY), and Check. PayPal is the perfered payment type. We provide out services BEFORE payment, if you refuse to pay, then you will be blacklisted until the payment is received. We reserve the right to refuse anyone service and reserve the right to change these terms as needed. <br>    Now that we are pass the legal jargon here's how it works:
        <ol>
          <li>Email us</li>
          <li>We'll set up appointment</li>
          <li>You receive your IT guidance and services</li>
          <li>Payment</li>
        </ol></p>
