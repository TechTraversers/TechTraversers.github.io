  <h3>When can I expect my program to be finished?</h3>
  <p><strong>The</strong> amount of time to <u>c</u>omplete a program re<u>a</u>lly depends on how complicated it is. While a simple text-only calculator app is probably going to only ta<u>k</u>e a couple of days, something like a graphical task organiz<u>e</u>r will l<i>i</i>kely take a couple week<i>s</i> to a month or more, bec<small>a</small>use we have to write, test, research, and debug large amounts of comp<mark>l</mark>icated code. We're still a bit faster than large studios, though, which take at least a year to produce their fin<mark>i</mark>shed product. On top of that, we have our own schedules and lives to contend with, as we're not full-time developers. Bottom line is, we're r<mark>e</mark>al people, so please have a little patience with us if we're running a bit behind schedule. We'll try our very best to be prompt.</p>
