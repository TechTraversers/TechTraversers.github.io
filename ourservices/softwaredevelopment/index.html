  <h3>When can I expect my program to be finished?</h3>
  <p>The amount of time to complete a program really depends on how complicated it is. While a simple text-only calculator app is probably going to only take a couple of days, something like a graphical task organizer will likely take a couple weeks to a month or more, because we have to write, test, research, and debug large amounts of complicated code. We're still a bit faster than large studios, though, which take at least a year to produce their finished product. On top of that, we have our own schedules and lives to contend with, as we're not full-time developers. Bottom line is, we're real people, so please have a little patience with us if we're running a bit behind schedule. We'll try our very best to be prompt.</p>
